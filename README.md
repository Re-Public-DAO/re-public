# Re-Public

Every person on the planet generates data that’s valuable to humanity. We all have a piece of the human puzzle which is currently impossible to assemble or reason about. From our genomes, to our decisions, to our relationships, to our daily activities … We are generating a value far greater than can currently be seen or manifested through software, consumer products, census data, or scientific studies.

To change this, and to profoundly reduce inequality around the world, Re-Public wants to give every person who wants one a private cloud computing environment. While the software itself is free to use, permissionless, and auditable, its purpose is to create a completely private digital environment for the individual. 

It includes private clouds, private networks, and decentralized coordination systems, which together eliminate all intermediaries between a person and their data while preserving and vastly extending the functionality people expect from the internet today.
